/**
 * The purpose of generated class in src/main/java for Union types is to create new instances of unions from a string representation.
 * In some cases it is very difficult to automate it since there can be unions such as (uint32 - uint16), or (string - uint32).
 * The reason behind putting it under src/main/java is:
 * This class is generated in form of a stub and needs to be finished by the user. This class is generated only once to prevent
 * loss of user code.
